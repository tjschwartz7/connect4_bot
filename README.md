I built this thing using a form of Monte Carlo algorithm to try a bunch of moves and select whichever move won the most often. The algorithm runs each possible move for half a second before picking whichever move won the most often.
The computer plays as player 2 by default. It's very possible to beat, and I'm guessing it isn't picking optimal moves. It might be more accurate if I made it run longer, but then it'd be less playable.
