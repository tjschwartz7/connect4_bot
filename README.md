I built this thing using a form of Monte Carlo algorithm to try a bunch of moves and select whichever move won the most often. The algorithm runs each possible move for half a second before picking whichever move won the most often.
The computer plays as player 2 by default. As you can see if you look at the source file, I did manage to beat it once. 
But it usually wins because my human brain is weak against its raw computational power.
